# 2. Course Outline
## 2.1. Objectives

1. This course introduces the **basic knowledge of Quality-of-Service (QoS)**. Four main issues will be addressed:
    1. Multimedia Applications 
    2. QoS Fundamentals 
    3. QoS Mechanisms 
    4. Selected Standards

    > [!NOTE]
    >We give an overview of the multimedia application. The fundamentals of Quality of Service (QoS) is then introduced. Some commonly used QoS Mechanisms will be given. Finally, we will use some popular wireless standards as examples to illustrate the usage of the QoS mechanisms. (The assessment for this part is through **Midterm Exam**).
3. **Interpersonal** & **teamwork** skills practice through 5 assignments.
